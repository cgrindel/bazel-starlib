This rule executes a binary target with the specified arguments. It generates \
a Bash script that contains a call to the binary with the arguments embedded \
in the script. This is useful in the following situations:

1. If one wants to embed a call to a binary target with a set of arguments in \
another rule.

2. If you define a binary target that has a number of dependencies and other \
configuration values and you do not want to replicate it elsewhere.

Why Not Use A Macro?

You can use a macro which encapsulates the details of the xxx_binary \
declaration. However, the dependencies for the xxx_binary declaration must be \
visible anywhere the macro is used.
