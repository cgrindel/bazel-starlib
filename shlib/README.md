# Shlib 

Shlib is a library of Bash shell functions that are useful when implementing shell binaries,
libraries, and tests.


## Quickstart

The following provides a quick introduction on how to get started using the libraries in this
project.

###  Workspace Configuration

[Add the workspace snippet for the repository to your `WORKSPACE` file.](/README.md#workspace-configuration)


### Reference Libraries As Dependencies

Add the desired library and the Bazel runfiles as a dependency to your shell binary, library, or
test declaration. In this example, the
[sh_binary](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/be/shell.html#sh_binary) has a dependency on the
`paths.sh` library.

```python
sh_binary(
    name = "foo",
    srcs = ["foo.sh"],
    deps = [
        "@bazel_tools//tools/bash/runfiles",
        "@cgrindel_bazel_starlib//shlib/lib:paths",
    ],
)
```

### Source The Library And Use It

In your shell script, add the following to source the library. 

```sh
# --- begin runfiles.bash initialization v2 ---
# Copy-pasted from the Bazel Bash runfiles library v2.
set -uo pipefail; f=bazel_tools/tools/bash/runfiles/runfiles.bash
source "${RUNFILES_DIR:-/dev/null}/$f" 2>/dev/null || \
  source "$(grep -sm1 "^$f " "${RUNFILES_MANIFEST_FILE:-/dev/null}" | cut -f2- -d' ')" 2>/dev/null || \
  source ".runfiles/$f" 2>/dev/null || \
  source "$(grep -sm1 "^$f " ".runfiles_manifest" | cut -f2- -d' ')" 2>/dev/null || \
  source "$(grep -sm1 "^$f " ".exe.runfiles_manifest" | cut -f2- -d' ')" 2>/dev/null || \
  { echo>&2 "ERROR: cannot find $f"; exit 1; }; f=; set -e
# --- end runfiles.bash initialization v2 ---

# Load the library file
paths_lib="$(rlocation cgrindel_bazel_starlib/shlib/lib/paths.sh)"
source "${paths_lib}"

# ...

# Use the library functions
foo_path="$(normalize_path "${foo_path}")"
```

If you want to avoid sourcing a library that has already been loaded, the following code will check
if the library is already loaded.

```sh
# Load the library file, it it is not already loaded.
if [[ $(type -t cgrindel_bazel_shlib_lib_paths_loaded) != function ]]; then
  paths_lib="$(rlocation cgrindel_bazel_starlib/shlib/lib/paths.sh)"
  source "${paths_lib}"
fi
```
